    <h1>The Best Movies According to Dant√° Kelly </h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr /> 

    <h3> Venom: Let There Be Carnage</h3>
        <p>I like this movie due to the fact that it entails how an alienated being gets trapped
        into a human body & forces the human to eat it's own kind at times.</p>
        
    <h3>Spider Man: Far From Home</h3>      
        <p>This movie is like no other for me, seeing Tom Holland & Zendaya showing love 
        to each other is like a goal of what I want coin in the future.</p> 

    <h3>Spiderman: No Way Home</h3>
        <p>Seeing all the Spiderman conjoin together as a team to defeat the villans 
         was what gets me excited while watching this mocvie </p>
