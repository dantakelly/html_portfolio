        <hr> 
    <p>My name is Danta Kelly, an aspiring software developer trying to gather as much knowledge 
       as possible before I attend college. I am 17 years old. I used to make music but got bored 
       over time, so I transitioned over to coding, which I am enjoying thus far. </p>
